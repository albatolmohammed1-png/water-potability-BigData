## Water Potability Prediction (Big Data Project)

This project analyzes water quality and predicts potability (drinkability) using PySpark and Random Forest models.  
The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle:

ðŸ”— [Water Potability Dataset â€“ Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability)

The analysis includes:
- Data cleaning and handling missing values  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using PySpark  
- Model training and evaluation (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)  
- Identifying key physicochemical factors affecting water safety  

Project developed as part of a Big Data coursework project.
